        "question": "How do I handle events in React.js?",
        "answer": "In React.js, you can handle events by passing event handler functions as props to the corresponding elements. These event handlers can then update the component state or trigger other actions in response to user interactions."

      {
        "question": "What is a React.js Hook?",
        "answer": "Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a more flexible and concise way to work with component state and lifecycle methods."
